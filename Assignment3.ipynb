    "This assignment aims to provide the necessary practices for learning the principles of deep learning programing in NLP using PyTorch. To this end, Task A provides the space for becoming fully familiar with PyTorch programming by implementing a \"simple\" document (sentence) classification model with PyTorch, and Task B extends this classifier with a BERT model. As the assignment requires working with PyTorch and Huggingface Transformers, please familiarize yourself with these libraries using any possible available teaching resources in particular the libraries' documentations. The assignment has in total **40 points**, and also offers **2 extra points** which can cover any missing point.\n",

    "The aim of this task is identical to the one of Assignment 2 - Task B, namely to design a document classification model that exploits pre-trained word embeddings. It is of course allowed to use the preprocessed text, the dictionary, or any other relevant code or processings, done in the previous assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you implement a document classification model using PyTorch, which given a document/sentence (consisting of a set of words) predicts the corresponding class. Before getting started with coding, have a look at the <a href=\"#section-tensorboard\">optional task</a>, as you may want to already include `Tensorboard` in the code. The implementation of the classifier should cover the points below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing and dictionary (1 point):** Following previous assignments, load the train, validation, and test datasets, apply necessary preprocessing steps, and create a dictionary of words. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data batching (4 points):** Using the dictionary, create batches for any given dataset (train/validation/test). Each batch is a two-dimensional matrix of *batch-size* to *max-document-length*, containing the IDs of the words in the corresponding documents. *Batch-size* and *max-document-length* are two hyper-parameters and can be set to any appropriate values (*Batch-size* must be higher than 1 and *max-document-length* at least 50 words). If a document has more than *max-document-length* words, only the first *max-document-length* words should be kept.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word embedding lookup (2 point):** Using `torch.nn.Embedding`, create a lookup for the embeddings of all the words in the dictionary. The lookup is in fact a matrix, which maps the ID of each word to the corresponding word vector. Similar to Assignment 2, use the pre-trained vectors of a word embedding model (like word2vec or GloVe) to initialize the word embeddings of the lookup. Keep in mind that the embeddings of the words in the lookup should be matched with the correct vector in the pretrained word embedding. If the vector of a word in the lookup does not exist in the pretrained word embeddings, the corresponding vector should be initialized randomly. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Model definition (3 points):** Define the class `ClassificationAverageModel` as a PyTorch model. In the initialization procedure, the model receives the word embedding lookup, and includes it in the model as model's parameters. These embeddings parameters should be trainable, meaning that the word vectors get updated during model training. Feel free to add any other parameters to the model, which might be necessary for accomplishing the functionalities explained in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward function (5 points):** The forward function of the model receives a batch of data, and first fetches the corresponding embeddings of the word IDs in the batch using the lookup. Similar to Assignment 2, the embedding of a document is created by calculating the *element-wise mean* of the embeddings of the document's words. Formally, given the document $d$, consisting of words $\\left[ v_1, v_2, ..., v_{|d|} \\right]$, the document representation $\\mathbf{e}_d$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{e}_d = \\frac{1}{|d|}\\sum_{i=1}^{|d|}{\\mathbf{e}_{v_i}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{e}_{v}$ is the vector of the word $v$, and $|d|$ is the length of the document. An important point in the implementation of this formula is that the documents in the batch might have different lengths and therefore each document should be divided by its corresponding $|d|$. Finally, this document embedding is utilized to predict the probability of the output classes, done by applying a linear transformation from the embeddings size to the number of classes, followed by Softmax. The linear transformation also belongs to the model's parameters and will be learned in training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loss Function and optimization (2 point):** The loss between the predicted and the actual classes is calculated using Negative Log Likelihood or Cross Entropy. Update the model's parameters using any appropriate optimization mechanism such as Adam.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Early Stopping (2 points):** After each epoch, evaluate the model on the *validation set* using accuracy. If the evaluation result (accuracy) improves, save the model as the best performing one so far. If the results are not improving after a certain number of evaluation rounds (set as another hyper-parameter) or if training reaches a certain number of epochs, terminate the training procedure. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Set Evaluation (1 point):** After finishing the training, load the (already stored) best performing model, and use it for class prediction on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reporting (1 point):** During loading and processing the collection, provide sufficient information and examples about the data and the applied processing steps. Report the results of the best performing model on the validation and test set in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall functionality of the training procedure (4 point).**\n"

The forward function of the model receives a batch of data, passes this batch to BERT, and achieves the corresponding document embeddings from the output of BERT.
